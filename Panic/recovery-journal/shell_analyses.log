- During this period, I nearly eliminated caffeine!
- I had just over 1 sweet/day, very close to my goal
- More troubling is alcohol, with an average of 3.1 drinks/day (or ~22/week!)

  units the previous day
- Overall average was ~0.1/day: caffeine might have a current day effect, but
  the data is too sparse! I was already well into reducing my caffeine intake
  by the time I started recording
